# Harvard CS50 – Intro to SQL 🗄️

This repository contains my **notes, SQL queries, schemas, and problem set solutions** from the **Harvard CS50 – Introduction to Databases (SQL)** course.

The main goal of this repository is to build **strong SQL & database fundamentals** as a solid step before starting **JDBC** and advanced **Java backend development**.

---

## 📌 Why This Repository?

Before working with **JDBC**, it's essential to deeply understand:
- How databases work
- How SQL queries are written and optimized
- How data is modeled and constrained

This repo documents my **learning journey**, practice, and notes while studying SQL properly.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand SQL **conceptually**, not just syntax
- Write clean, readable, and efficient SQL queries
- Learn how relational databases are designed
- Prepare for:
  - JDBC
  - Backend development with Java
  - Software Engineer & Backend interviews

---

## 🚀 How to Use This Repo

1. Start with the files in `notes/`  
2. Practice queries from `queries/`  
3. Solve problems in `problems/` **before checking solutions**  
4. Use `schemas/` to understand database design  
5. Review quickly using `cheatsheet/`

---

## 🧠 Notes & Guidelines

- All SQL queries are written manually
- No copy-paste learning — focus is on **why**, not just **how**
- The repository will be continuously updated during the learning process
- Queries are database-agnostic unless stated otherwise
